# Checkpoint 2 instructions

In this file you will find all the instructions to complete the next checkpoint. Please complete the following:

1.  Make a copy of the .RMD file you turned in for the first checkpoint and save that original copy for your records.

2.  Copy all the code starting with the next code chunk and paste that into the end of your .RMD file from the last checkpoint. Once done, you will no longer work on this file "Term_Project_pt2_instructions.rmd". All work should be done in your original .RMD file. The goal is to have a single running document that you add onto for each checkpoint.

3.  Take into account the peer and instructor feedback from checkpoint one and make any edits as needed. That section will be regraded for 2 points.

4.  Answer each of the questions listed below.

5.  Knit your .RMD document as a pdf and submit it in two separate locations on Canvas. One is the checkpoint itself. The other is the associated peer review assignment for next week.

### COPY AND PASTE EVERYTHING BELOW INTO THE END OF YOUR .RMD FILE FROM THE LAST CHECKPOINT

```{r instructions2, include=FALSE}
