# Checkpoint 2 instructions

In this file you will find all the instructions to complete the next checkpoint. Please complete the following:

1. Examine all the feedback you got on checkpoint 1. Do you need to modify your question, prediction, or hypothesis? 

2. Copy your work from checkpoint one into this document in the space provided. 

3.  Take into account the peer and instructor feedback from checkpoint one and make any edits to the work you just pasted in as needed. That section will be regraded for 2 points.

4.  Answer each of the questions listed below.

5.  Knit your .RMD document as a pdf and submit it in two separate locations on Canvas. One is the checkpoint itself. The other is the associated peer review assignment for next week.

```{r instructions2, include=FALSE}
#In the space below, paste in all of the work you did in part 1. Copy all the code from your .rmd file starting at line 39 of that document. including the all the'\newpage' and `instructions` formatting. Once your work has been pasted into this document, take the time to make any corrections based on the peer and instructor feedback you received. This section will be worth 2 points in this assignment.
